               <p>Every new app development project begins with strategy and planning. This is probably the most important phase in the development cycle of any app. In our strategy workshop we dissect the app idea to assess it’s commercial viability. We look at the market and competitors, develop a water-tight unique selling proposition (USP) and thoroughly research our target users. We then move into product design road-mapping. Together with our clients we map out the features, flows and user journey. Our unique product strategy process puts our client’s business goals at the forefront. Every strategic decision serves those business goals, minimising cost and risk while maximising the app’s opportunity for success.</p><br><br>
